Investment Analysis in Areas Surrounding Commercial Corridors
Project Proposal

Scope of the Project: 

The project aims to analyze private investments in areas surrounding commercial corridors by permit type and property type. 
The analysis will cover investments made in the last seven years (2015-2022) within a ½ mile radius of each corridor. 
The project will also rank the corridors based on private investment, controlling for differences in acreage/square footage/total number of properties.

Potential Data Sets:

1.	Building Permit Data(2015-2022).xlsx: Project Est. value, Application Type(property type, Permit type), date issued, 
and location, Property Data: Acreage, square footage, and number of properties within ½ mile radius of each corridor.

Methodology:

1.	Data Cleaning: The data will be cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency and accuracy using tools including Microsoft Excel, Python, and R

2.	Data Analysis will be performed using Tableau Business Intelligence software and R.

a. Visualization: A heat map will be created to show the trend of total investment in each corridor's surrounding properties. The heat map will use color coding to represent the level of investment. 
b. Investment by Permit Type: A bar graph will be used to compare investments by permit type (new buildings vs. renovations). 
c. Investment by Property Type: A pie chart will be used to compare investments by property type (multi-family or mixed-use residential, single-family or duplex residential, commercial, industrial) for new buildings,
and a separate pie chart for renovations (residential vs. commercial vs. industrial).

Anticipated Business Outcomes: 

The project will provide insights into the trends and patterns of private investments in areas surrounding commercial corridors.
The analysis will help businesses, investors, and policymakers decide where to invest and how to allocate resources. 
The project will also identify areas that require more investment and development, and potential obstacles to investment.
