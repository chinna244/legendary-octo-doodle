Analysis of Patient's stay in the hospital

Introduction

Reducing the length of stay (LOS) at hospitals decreases the cost of care for patients, thereby improving financial, operational, 
and clinical outcomes. Additionally, hospital-acquired conditions can be minimized, improving outcomes. Analyzing industry data is a 
critical component of healthcare analytics, which helps predict trends, improve outreach, and even control disease spread. 
Healthcare management uses different metrics for measuring performance, but the length of stay of a patient is one of the most important. 
When LOS is decreased, hospitals can match the demand for elective and emergent admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) care, 
and interhospital transfers with capacity.

Project Goal

The purpose of this project is to predict how long patients will stay in a hospital, allowing hospitals to optimize their resources 
and function more efficiently.
